Project : 
   C++ Hangman Game
Game Requirment :   
   1.Choose the word to guess randomly from an array of preselected strings. For example,
     string words[5]= {"strawberry", "lime", "orange", "lemon", "mango"};
     program randomly chooses a word from this hard coded list.
   2.Allow the user to guess only an alphabetic letter (A to Z (uppercase) or a to z (lowercase))
   3.Each round, display the correctly guessed letters and their placement in the word. For example: * * * * may become * * m * when the user guesses m for the word lime.
   4.Keep track of the number of points/the score. You can be creative with how points are allocated, but your method should be purposeful/reasonable.
   5.Instead of a display for the arms, legs, etc., display the number of attempts left. In hangman, there is a head, 2 legs, 2 arms, and a torso, so 6 wrong guesses are allowed.
   6.Each round, display all previously guessed letters, regardless of whether they were right or wrong. 
   7.After each game, regardless of win or lose, ask the user if he/she wants to play again.
