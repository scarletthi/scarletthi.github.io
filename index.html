    <h1>LET THE JOURNEY BEGIN: MYANMAR </h1>
    <p><b>About me</b>: WELCOME to my website. My name is Thi Thi Aung. I am from Yangon, Myanmar. I am currently majoring in Computer Science at Long Island University in downtown Brooklyn, New York.
    Programming is one my favorite classes. I love writing code because the feeling of finishing code of a certain application, and watching computer 'live' in the way I pre-determined, it is unbelievable.
    I love cooking and do shopping with my best friends during spare time. I also love to travel as I believe it gives me the freedom to be myself. Last but not least, this site will tour you where I really come from
    and explore famous places.</p>
